# Authentication and API Requests

# This sample script demonstrates logging into the Cisco Kinetic for Cities (CKC) Platform,
# obtaining an access_token that can be used to further interact with the platform, then making
# a basic call to obtain the User details. 
#
# The main ideas in this sample are:
#   1) Logging in
#   2) Parsing the login reponse to get the access_token needed for futher API calls
#   3) Using the token to make another API request to get the Users details

#Ignore invalid Certificates
ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context

#   1) Logging In
# The CKC URL needed for initial login
loginUrl = 'https://ckcsandbox.cisco.com/corev4/token'

# specify default values so you don't have to type them in every time
# @Note: these are not valid, so you need to replace them with your actual username and password

#Define the required three Headers for the initial Login Post
headers = {
    'Cache-Control': "no-cache",
    'Content-Type': "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
    'Postman-Token': "2915798c-f468-407c-a2dd-8897e441102b"
    }

# This dictionary contains the post body we will send to the /token API
# @Note: These are the sample sandbox client_id and client_secret values, so you will
#        need to replace them with yours as provided with your reservation
postData = {
    'client_secret':'2uweuddI8VP4LqJ5N2ivbz2FKWga',
    'client_id':'UuWdMkRiVQS43CFsNU_V2Qf_kn0a',
    'grant_type':'password'
}

# get username and password from commandline
# For the first time user, the password will need to be set manually by logging into CKC dashboard, the link for which will be sent to the emailID
username = input('Enter username (email address): ')

password = input('Enter password: ')

# Add username/password to post data
postData['username'] = username
postData['password'] = password


# urlencode the data
data = urllib.parse.urlencode(postData)

# use UTF-8 encoding for POST data and responses
encoding = 'UTF-8'

# POST needs binary data, so encode it
binary_data = data.encode(encoding)

print('\nLogging in:' + loginUrl + '\n')

# urlopen with data causes a post request
request = urllib.request.Request(loginUrl,  binary_data)
response = urllib.request.urlopen(request)

#   2) Parsing the login reponse to get the access_token needed for further API calls
# process the results and put into a JSON object/dictionary
results = response.read().decode(encoding)
responseDictionary = json.loads(results)
access_token = responseDictionary['access_token']
print('Response:', responseDictionary)


#   3) Using the token to make another API request
#Define the required Headers for a secondary GET request to obtain user details
#The url to obtain account details is GET to baseURL/cdp/v1/accounts/user/login

headers = {
    'authorization': "Bearer " + access_token,
    'Content-Type': "application/json"
    }

#The URL to request user details
requestUrl = 'https://ckcsandbox.cisco.com/t/devnet.com/cdp/v1/accounts/user/login'

print('\nGetting User Details: (' + requestUrl + ')\n')

# create the request
request = urllib.request.Request(requestUrl, headers = headers)

# perform the request
response = urllib.request.urlopen(request)

results = response.read().decode(encoding)
responseDictionary = json.loads(results)

user_id = responseDictionary['id']

print('User Details:', results, '\n')

print('These items will be used in Lesson-2:')
print('Your Access Token:', access_token)
print('Your User ID:',user_id)
